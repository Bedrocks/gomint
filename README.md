# GoMint

GoMint is a Minecraft PocketEdition server implementation that is still work in progress. The goal is
to provide a full, modifiable server with plugin support for Java.

The project itself is divided into two modules: gomint-api and gomint-server. The latter one contains the
server-side implementation and is not to be used by other software directly whereas gomint-api will offer
a clean and easy-to-use API for creating custom plugins once GoMint sees its first release. Currently the
API does not yet exist as the implementation is still under such rapid development that we are not yet able
to settle on a fixed API layout.

## Testing

As the project is still work in progress the only way to launch the application currently is to set up
your respective IDE and provide a working directory that contains a regular Minecraft PC Anvil World.
Afterwards you may join the server using your version of MCPE.
